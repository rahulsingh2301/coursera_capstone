They can do grocery shopping, dine at restaurants, shop at the various fashion outlets, watch movies and perform many more activities. Shopping malls are like a one stop destination for all types of shoppers. For retailers, the central location and the large cloud at the shopping malls provides a great distribution channel to market their products and services. property developers are also taking advantage of this trend to build more shopping malls to cater to the demand. As a result, there are many shopping malls in the city of Kuala Lumpur and many many more are being built. Opening shopping malls allow property developers to earn consistent rental income. Ofcourse, as with any business decision, opening a shopping mall requires serious considerationans and is a lot more complicated than it seems. particularly, the location of the shopping mall is one of the most important deciions that will determine whether the mall will be a success or a failure.</p>"

The local newspaper The Malay Mail also reported in March last year that the true occupancy rates in malls may be as low as 40 per cent in some areas, quoting a Financial Times(FT) article cataloguing the country's continued obsession with building more shopping space despite chronic oversupply.</p>"
